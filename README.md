# Predicting Job Seniority from Descriptions using NLP

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to classify job descriptions by their required seniority level ‚Äî such as *Internship*, *Entry level*, or *Mid-Senior level* ‚Äî using real-world job postings in the machine learning field.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: - <a href="https://github.com/shaoshaooo/Predicting-Job-Seniority-from-Descriptions-using-NLP/blob/main/1000_ml_jobs_us.csv">1000 ml jobs usa Dataset</a>
- **Goal**: Predict the seniority level of a job based on its description
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Python
  - pandas, scikit-learn
  - spaCy (for lemmatization and stopword filtering)
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

---

## Workflow

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Lowercasing, lemmatization, stopword removal using spaCy
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - TF-IDF Vectorization of cleaned descriptions
3. **Modeling**:
   - Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict seniority
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Classification report
   - Confusion matrix
   - Label distribution visualization
5. **Custom Input Testing**:
   - Predicts seniority level from any new job description

## üìà Visualizations

### üîπ Confusion Matrix
Shows how well the model distinguishes between different seniority levels.

### üîπ Predicted Class Distribution
Displays how frequently the model predicted each seniority level.

## Sample Prediction

```python
text = """
We are looking for a machine learning engineer to lead the development of scalable AI systems. 
Must have 5+ years of experience and proven leadership in team-based projects.
"""

predict_seniority(text)  ‚ûù  "Mid-Senior level"
